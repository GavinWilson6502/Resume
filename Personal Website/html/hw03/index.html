    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
    Welcome to Wing Cap, Inc., a company dedicated to providing free aftermarket software
    to help you make your hardware your own, with the additional goal of allowing you to
    keep perfectly good systems usable even after their manufacturers cut official
    support.
    </p>
    <h2>Products</h2>
    <h3><a href="products/wingcapos/">Wing Cap OS</a></h3>
    <p>
    Our primary product is Wing Cap OS, a free and open-source GNU/Linux distribution.
    It can be installed on a wide range of systems, including PCs, servers, and even
    mobile devices.
    </p>
    <h3><a href="products/mserieshw/">M Series Hardware</a></h3>
    <p>
    Since installing aftermarket software may not be an easy task for some, we offer the M
    Series line of hardware devices, optimized for compatibility with Wing Cap OS, with
    Wing Cap OS pre-installed.
    </p>
    <h2>Services</h2>
    <h3><a href="services/consulting/">Consulting</a></h3>
    <p>
    Wing Cap OS can be a great choice for businesses that rely on legacy systems, as we
    are committed to providing continued, stable support and compatibility for all
    possible installation environments. In service of this, we offer paid consultation to
    help you set up and maintain your systems with our products.
    </p>

    Note: any perceived similarities between the branding, products, or business model of
    Wing Cap, Inc. and that of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"
    target="_blank">Red Hat, Inc.</a> are purely coincidental and should be paid no mind.
    In fact, you're probably just imagining it, so don't even bother clicking that link to
    find out more about the company we definitely aren't copying.
    </p>
    <!--
      Clarification: the company is very defensive about their unoriginality (I made up
      Wing Cap based on Red Hat with a few elements of a project called postmarketOS
      sprinkled in) and wants to mess with those who would compare them to others; the
      external page linked above is of relevance to the company in that it fulfills this
      purpose.
