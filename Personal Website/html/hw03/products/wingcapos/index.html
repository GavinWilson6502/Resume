    <p>
    Wing Cap OS is meant to be used in a wide variety of situations. Our most optimized
    versions are those for PC, server, mobile, and embedded systems, but the operating
    system can easily be adapted for other uses.
    </p>
    <h3>I can't get Wing Cap OS to work! What should I do?</h3>
    <p>
    We suggest looking into our <a href="../../services/consulting/">consultation
    services</a> for assistance. By reaching out to us, you not only allow us to find a
    solution for your particular situation, but you also enable us to provide more general
    solutions for others by making improvements to the OS itself.
    </p>
    <h3>Something about all this feels familiar...</h3>
    <p>No it doesn't</p>
    <h3>Why should I use Wing Cap OS over other operating systems?</h3>
    <p>
    Wing Cap OS is designed to be compatible with a wide range of systems, and painless
    to replace proprietary software with. Other operating systems tend to prioritize some
    platforms at the expense of others; we make sure to give all kinds of platforms equal
    amounts of attention, and not play favorites.
